MNIST Digit Classification Project
Overview
This project uses the MNIST dataset to train a logistic regression classifier to detect the digit '2'. The dataset is fetched from OpenML and preprocessed for training. The classifier is then evaluated using cross-validation.

Requirements
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
matplotlib
numpy
Dataset
The MNIST dataset is fetched from OpenML using fetch_openml.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets (60,000 and 10,000 samples, respectively).
Classifier
A logistic regression classifier is trained on the training set to detect the digit '2'.
The classifier is implemented using scikit-learn's LogisticRegression class.
Evaluation
The classifier is evaluated using cross-validation with 3 folds.
The accuracy of the classifier is calculated and printed.
Code Structure
fetching_dataset: Fetches the MNIST dataset from OpenML.
data_preprocessing: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets, and preprocesses the data for training.
classifier_training: Trains the logistic regression classifier on the training set.
evaluation: Evaluates the classifier using cross-validation.
Example Use Case
Run the code to train the classifier and evaluate its accuracy.
Use the trained classifier to predict whether a given image is a '2' or not.
Files
README.md: This file.
mnist_digit_classification.py: The main Python script for the project.
Running the Code
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the code using python mnist_digit_classification.py.
Note
This is a basic example of a digit classification project using the MNIST dataset.
The classifier can be improved by tuning hyperparameters, using different algorithms, or using more advanced techniques such as convolutional neural networks.
